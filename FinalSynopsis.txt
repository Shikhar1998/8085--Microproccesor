The primary objective of our project is to create a hardware implementation of the game 'Tic-Tac-Toe' with the facillity of playing against
the 8085 microprocessor. The microprocessor will algorithmically analyse the state of the game and pick the most optimum move so as to ensure
that it always wins or draws. We intend to use the MinMax algorithm to determine the moves to be picked by the 8085. This project intends to 
highlight the decision making capability of microprocessors.
